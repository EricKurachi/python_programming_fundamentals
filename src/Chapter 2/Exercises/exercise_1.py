Type in the code of Example 2.6. Execute the code using a debugger like the one
included with the Wing IDE 101. Step into and over the code using the debugger.
Enter a menu choice of 1. Using the line numbers in Example 2.6, which lines of
the program are executed when you enter a 1 for the menu choice. List these lines.
Do the same for each of the other menu choice values. If you run the program and
enter a menu choice of 5, which lines of the program are executed. If you use the
debugger to answer this question you will be guaranteed to get it right and youâ€™ll
learn a little about using a debugger.
