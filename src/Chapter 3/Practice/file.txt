A file is a grouping of related data that can be read by a computer program. Files
may be stored in many different places including the hard drive, a thumb drive, on
a CD, at a network location, really any place where a program could have access to
it. While files occur in many forms and sizes, a text file is a bunch of text written
using an editor and usually stored on a hard drive. Files can be read and written from
Python programs. Files are another type of sequence as far as Python programs are
concerned and we can iterate over them just as we would any sequence. Files are
sequences of strings, one string for each line of the file. To read from a file we open
it and then iterate over the lines of the file.
